Welcome to the Marathi Numbers Drag and Drop Game! This interactive web application helps children learn Marathi numbers by matching them with their English equivalents through a fun drag-and-drop interface.

## Game Overview

In this game, players are presented with a list of numbers in English and their corresponding Marathi translations. The objective is to drag the English numbers and drop them onto the correct Marathi equivalents. If the pair is correct, a positive feedback message is displayed; if incorrect, a corrective message is shown.

## How to Play

2. **Drag and Drop:**
   - Once the numbers are generated, drag an English number and drop it onto the matching Marathi translation.
   - If the pair is correct, a message will display "बरोबर जोडी!" ("Correct pair!") in green.
   - If the pair is incorrect, a message will display "चुकीची जोडी!" ("Wrong pair!") in red.
